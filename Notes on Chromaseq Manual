Notes regarding Chromaseq & Chromaseq manual

1 - In VChromWindow, the method switchView is empty (there's code there, but it is 
all commented out).  This method is called from the Chromatograms > View menu, to switch between 
Chromatogram / Overview view.  The method should do something or the option should be removed from
the menu. lines 2369-2380 in VChromWindow

2 - In the chromatogram window, the show/hide chromatogram triangles do not disappear when clicked.
That is, after clicking on the triangleRight, the triangleDown is drawn over the triangleRight, but 
triangleRight is still visable.  The correct triangle is always shown on top, but the wrong one (after 
the initial click) is visable beneath.  Maybe a VM thing?

3 - I'm not sure that Chromatograms > Arrows > Jump to next Read-Read Conflict is doing
what it is supposed to do.  It wasn't doing anything despite conflicts being present between the 
reads.  Other Arrow functions work fine.

4 - The scroll bar does not appear when the chromatogram window opens.  Re-sizing the window forces re-
drawing, and the scollbar appears then.  VM issue?

5 - There was a 'Link To Matrix' stub on the navigation page of the chromaseq manual.  I don't know  
what this refers to.

6 - Should Chromatogram > Show Fades actually be a checkMenuItem?  It was once so (commented out), and 
because it toggles whether the sequence is faded or not, a checkMenuItem (as opposed to a menuItem, which
it is currently) might be more appropriate...line 113 in VChromWindow

7 - Maybe a bigger issue than Chromaseq: When using Phred/phrap from within Mesquite 
(File > Open other... or Utilities), the dialog asking the user to Choose directory containing ABI
files is a bit confusing.  Clicking the 'Open' button will tell Mesquite to process files in the 
selected directory.  Double-clicking on that directory will open ('go into') that directory.  Perhaps the 
'Open' button should be a 'Choose' button.  Otherwise, users may try to navigate through the directory
structure using it (which won't work, because Phred/Phrap starts upon the first click of 'Open').  That, 
or add another, separate 'Choose' button to perform the function the 'Open' button currently performs.
