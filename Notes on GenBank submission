Notes on GenBank submission
----------


Have a tab-delimited file with the information you want to attach to the FASTA files.

The file should have the first line be a title line, and should use the official modifiers for FASTA files
(see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Sequin/modifiers.html).  

The first column should be the sample code:

code	organism	authority	identified-by	country	lat-lon	specimen-voucher
0050	Bembidion (Bracteon) balli	Bembidion balli Lindroth, 1962		Canada: Saskatchewan: Paynton Ferry	53.1027 N 108.9309 W	DRMaddison DNA0050


Then, in the Mesquite file, open up the taxon list window, and under the Columns menu, choose

	Voucher ID Code

and 

	Voucher Database
	
to display a column for each of these.

In the Voucher ID code, enter the code (must match the equivalent code in the 
first column of the tab delimited text file.

In the Voucher Database, select the entire list, and touch on the title to browse for the 
tab-delimited text file.
